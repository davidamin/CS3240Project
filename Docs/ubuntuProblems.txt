Important times:
We're meeting on Sunday at 2 to do the last big push
We can also work monday in lab
The code is due at 11:30 on the 28th
We're demoing at 3:50 on the 30th, but at least two of us need to be there 15 minutes early. Demos are in Rice 340.

PROBLEMS:
-Move out doesn't trigger an event (an ongoing watchdog issue)
-Rename doesn't trigger an event
-STAT isn't working perfectly, will look in to the issues more
-DOWNLOAD isn't working perfectly, occasionally 404s, 

NEED TWO "EXTRA" STORIES:
-Download Links(could also have a "shared" folder)
-Saved Client Login, could add list
-Allow/Disallow extensions
Can add more if time permits

POLISH:
-Return a more nicely formatted list for users/server log/ etc
-Log needs to be more user friendly in the console, the actual file can still be detailed

TEST:
Fresh "install"
Access across network
We should probably do one "full" test with the final code we plan on submitting, which will include:
	Testing the user functions(create account, sign in, change pass, toggle sync)
	Testing the background for the user(add, remove, move in, move out, rename, new directory)
	Test admin functions(see users, see server stats, see server log, remove user and files, change user passwords)
	Test cross client sync and across network access
	Test additional stories, whatever they may be
