Important times:
We're meeting on Sunday at 2 to do the last big push
We can also work monday in lab
The code is due at 11:30 on the 28th
We're demoing at 3:50 on the 30th, but at least two of us need to be there 15 minutes early. Demos are in Rice 340.

PROBLEMS:
-Move out doesn't trigger an event (an ongoing watchdog issue)
-Moving a directory in doesn't trigger an event
-Sync kind of works, kind of doesn't. More testing to come

NEED TWO "EXTRA" STORIES:
-Saved Client Login works, could add list
-Our sessions/ hashing passwords/ authenticating users might count as well
-Done with download links, of form download-link/<username>/<file in shared folder>
-Done with allow/disallow extensions. Only checks on upload, but that should be enough. Simply disallows upload of any file that isn't a valid one.
Can add more if time permits

TEST:
Fresh "install"
	-Change WORKING_DIR
	-Create the database
	-Run the server/client scripts

Access across network
	-Test adding a file and downloading it to another machine: PASS
	-Test deleting and deleting it on another machine: Need to retest
	-Test turning autosync off, making changes, then turning it on again: 
	-Test creating a directory and having it create on the other machine: New folder gets seen and created, but the rename bug duplicates it
	-Test deleting a directory and having it delete on the other machine: Need to retest
	-Test renaming files/directories across machines: Rename creates a new files on the other machine

We should probably do one "full" test with the final code we plan on submitting, which will include:
	Testing the user functions(create account, sign in, change pass, toggle sync)
	Testing the background for the user(add, remove, move in, move out, rename, new directory)
	Test admin functions(see users, see server stats, see server log, remove user and files, change user passwords)
	Test cross client sync and across network access
	Test additional stories, whatever they may be
