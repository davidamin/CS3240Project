CS3240 Sprint 2 Review

What did we get done?
Server can run and serve a port. Can handle some requests, although not all fully functional
Client side can create account, and Watchdog can look for any changes/additions/deletions, as well as for subdirectories

Risks:
We are struggling with upload, it needs to be done for other components to work
Watchdog hasn't actually done anything with the server yet, it only provides notifications
Differing workloads/schedules make it hard to meet/get work done

Risk Management:
We're going to prioritize the most essential tasks, so that we don't get caught up in development later

Project Management:
The partner system we've developed has been working, but going forward we might not be able to divide labor so easily
We should start to work more cohesively in the future as the tasks are no longer easy to split into teams

Planning:
