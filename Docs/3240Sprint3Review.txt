CS3240 Sprint 3 Review

What did we accomplish?
Both a User and Admin can change password.  Server can duplicate file changes made to the server and vice versa.  
Admin can pull user statistics on which files they have and their sizes (needs tweeking).   
Admins can also remove users and their files as well as viewing a connection log.
We got autosync working, which is also the first step toward multiple user support.

What do we need to do in the next sprint?
We must fully implement multiple user support, implement downloading a file from the server, test connectivity over a network across machines, test our code on Ubuntu fully, get the admin stat function working, and maybe implement some optional bonuses

Risks:
Network issues when transfering across machines.
We have only tested the program in OSX and not yet in Ubuntu.
We also need to work on being able to download files off of the server.
We are experiencing difficulties in development as a result of busy schedules.
Network issues when transfering across machines.

Risk Management:
We're going to begin testing our program in Ubuntu to make sure it will work, so we donâ€™t face problems later in development.
Need to find time to meet up if necessary
