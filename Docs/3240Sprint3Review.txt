Sprint 3 Review:
What did we accomplish?
We got admin functions working (for the most part, some further tweaks are required), and we got autosync working, which is also the first step toward multiple user support
What do we need to do in the next sprint?
We must fully implement multiple user support, implement downloading a file from the server, test connectivity over a network across machines, test our code on Ubuntu fully, get the admin stat function working, and maybe implement some optional bonuses
What are our risks going forward?
Network issues when transfering across machines, difficulties in development as a result of busy schedules, and failures in the implementing on Ubuntu
How do we manage risks?
We test new ground as soon as possible, and find time to meet up if necessary
